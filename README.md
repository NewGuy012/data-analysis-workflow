## Data Workflow

This is how I generally try to approach any data analysis task.

1. Define
    - Set clear objectives
2. Import
    - Support various data types
    - Explore raw data
    - Check for any inconsistency or corruption
3. Clean
    - Preprocess
    - Filter
    - Offset
    - Exclude outliers
4. Analyze
    - Postprocess
    - Derive custom metrics
    - Aggregate multiple values into one
    - Calculate common statistics that may shed insight
5. Export
    - Save a clean dataset
6. Report
    - Re-iterate process if needed
    - Generate deliverables
